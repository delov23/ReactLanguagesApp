A specific thing is that all the vowels are short in Bulgarian (а, ъ, о, у, е, и). Reading in Bulgarian is simple due to the fact that you read the same thing you have written. The Бulgarian language does not have grammatical cases. However, the nouns in it have genders, which are easily defined. Attention tо the masculine gender will be paid in the next lesson.","In English 'queue' is read as [`kju:] whereas in Bulgarian a word like 'опашка' (the Bulgarian for queue) will be read by just saying the sounds of the letters - [o`paʃka]."],"test":[{"$oid":"5c8a0f4976d892124cfea787"},{"$oid":"5c8a0f4976d892124cfea788"},{"$oid":"5c8a0f4976d892124cfea789"},{"$oid":"5c8a0f4976d892124cfea78a"}],"course":{"$oid":"5c877b01bb67182bac83fd00"},"title":"Our Alphabet","image":"https://static.memrise.com/img/400sqf/from/uploads/course_photos/5426621000140223094531.jpg","__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}
