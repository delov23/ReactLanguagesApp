##  1. Overview
  Lingo is an application that aims to teach one a new language in a fun and creative way. Basically, the project consists of two parts - a `back-end` one and a `front-end` one. The `back-end` fragment is created with the framework _express_ whereas in the `front-end` piece I have used _React_. The functionality is divided in two roles - Admin and User. The admin is the one who creates courses and lessons and removing them. The user can take advantage of all the available lessons. There is also an Anonymous role in which one can only see the home page, register and login.
